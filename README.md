# eYSIP-2016-Greenhouse Power Monitoring and Appliance Control
With this project we aim to make a "smart" device which is able to monitor electrical consumptions of various appliances(exhaust fan,fogger, water pump etc), inform the user about consumption and provide options for scheduling turn on/off time of appliance. The system will consist of a wi-fi enabled device which measure and display power consumption of an appliance. Device will be capable of turning on/off the device from web, scheduling the on/off time of the device. 

Wi-Fi Enabled Device will be created using the Following Hardware and Software Tools.
* **Microcontroller Board** CC3200 Wi-Fi Launchpad
* **Software Used**  Code Composer Studio v6.1.3,Energia, Cool-term , Tera Term

Website will be designed using the following Web development technologies:
* **Front-end+Back-end:**  HTML,PHP,CSS, Javascript (including JQuery and AJAX)
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Communication Protocol:** HTTP
* **Web Tools:** Notepad ++ Text editor
* **Development platform:** Windows
* **Target Environment:** Desktop


##Description:
***
> To be updated 

##Features:
*** 
* The system consists of a Wi-Fi enabled device which can measure and upload data on Web servers.
* It is the industry’s first on chip Wi-Fi microcontroller unit “CC3200”.
* Device is able to measure voltage, current, frequency and phase of electrical signals with high accuracy: 
 + Voltage sensitivity of the device is 0.093V.
 + Current sensitivity of the device is 0.0055A.
 + Error in frequency measurement is 3%.
* Number of ADC channel on the device restricts it to monitor only three connected electrical sockets but web based controlling feature can be extended to 20 more sockets.
* The web GUI allows user to monitor live data with real-time updating graphs, which can plot electrical parameters of 3 devices simultaneously.
* The data uploaded by the Wi-Fi enabled device is continuously logged in database and can be viewed as static graphs with options to choose the intervals.
* The GUI can also generate log in .csv file format for both selected interval and complete log.
* GUI also allows remote controlling of the connected devices with features like : 
  + 1.	Switching ON/OFF with power button.
  + 2.	Scheduling ON/OFF.
* A feedback system is also present to check and compare current Button status and actual Device status as sent by the Wi-Fi enabled device.
* The device has a terminal based interactive GUI to configure the Wi-Fi & server setting of device without looking into the code.


**Note:**

1. Source code should be documented with comments.
2. Daily Update of the Progress on the Github wiki.
